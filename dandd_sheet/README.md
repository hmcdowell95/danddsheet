##Sign up!

On the Homepage you should start by clicking sign up and create a username and password.

##Log in and out

If you have already signed up in the past the other option on the Homepage is Login.
Once you're signed in you'll be on the index page. On the index page you can logout or you can create a new character, view your character(s), and view other users characters!

##Create

The create form won't work without a class name and name. You can leave the other spots blank if you haven't rolled for your stats yet or quite figured out what you are doing with the character.

##View and Edit

From the index page you can view any character but you can only edit and delete your own characters. When your viewing a character the edit and delete button should be on the bottom of the page if you created the character.

###Hope the Dice roll in your favor!
